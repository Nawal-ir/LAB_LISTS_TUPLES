Movie Ratings Analysis
Scenario: You have just been hired as a data analyst at a movie streaming platform.
Your manager has given you a list of movies, each with a tuple containing the movie title, release year, and user ratings.
The platform allows users to rate movies on a scale of 1 to 10. Your manager wants you to create a Python program that:

   - Accepts a list of movies, with each movie represented as a tuple containing the movie title, release year, and a list of user ratings.
   - Calculates the average rating for each movie.
   - Filters out movies with an average rating lower than 6.0.
   - Displays the movies, along with their title, release year, and average rating.
